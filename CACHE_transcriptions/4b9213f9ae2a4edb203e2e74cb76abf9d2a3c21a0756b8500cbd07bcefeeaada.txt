 10448 5327 Cracker Barrel, I have a female stating that she just inform her husband that she's leaving him. I got to do an argument they drove separately. But he refuses to leave the parking lot of keep circling waiting for her to leave is in a Jeep Liberty. She say she does own a shotgun. She didn't see it on them, but she did see shotgun shells.  There's another part of Sam.  This is Rick. This sucks.
